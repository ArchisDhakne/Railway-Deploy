Click "New Project" from the dashboard

Railway will try to auto-configure:

Install Command: npm install

Start Command: npm start

🧠 Make sure your package.json has a script:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}

Or update it to whatever your entry file is (server.js, etc.)

🔹 Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Go to Settings > Variables tab

Add required environment variables, like:

MONGO_URI = your-mongodb-url
PORT = 3000
JWT_SECRET = your-secret

💡 Match these with your .env file

🔹 Step 5: Deploy and Get Your URL

Railway will automatically build and start your app

After success, you’ll get a public URL like:

https://your-app.up.railway.app

🎉 Now you can share this with your clients for testing!

🧪 Testing

Use tools like Postman or browser to hit:

https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/your-routes

✅ Auto-Deploy on Push

By default, Railway connects with GitHub:

Every push to the main branch triggers a new deployment.

You don’t have to manually redeploy.
